Author: <Your name>

Purpose: Assignment 05 - Factories and Dealers

Instructions:

- Read the comments in the following code.  
- Implement your code where the TODO comments are found.
- No global variables, all data must be passed to the objects.
- Only the included/imported packages are allowed.  
- Thread/process pools are not allowed
- You MUST use a barrier
- Do not use try...except statements
- You are not allowed to use the normal Python Queue object.  You must use Queue251.
- the shared queue between the threads that are used to hold the Car objects
  can not be greater than MAX_QUEUE_SIZE
