Author: Gabriel Ikpaetuk

Purpose: Drawing with Python Turtle

The follow program will draw a series of shapes - squares, circles, triangles
and rectangles.  

There is a Python class called cse251Turtle that is used to hold the drawing
commands that are created by the program.  This is required because threads can
not draw to the screen - only the main thread can do this.

Instructions:

- Find the "TODO" comment below and add your code that will use threads.
- You are not allowed to use any other Python modules/packages than the packages
  currently imported below.
- You can create other functions if needed.
- No global variables.
