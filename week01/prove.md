# 01 Prove: Drawing Shapes 

# Overview

You're first assignment is to draw shapes on the screen. When you download the file `assignment.py`, and run it.  It will create the following drawing on the screen.  Your task is to use threads for the drawing.

## Instructions

1. Download `assignment.py`, `drawpart1.txt` and `cse251turtle.py` from the `week01/assignment` folder in Github.  Create a folder on your computer that will contain these files. Read the header in the `assignment.py` file. Here is [GutHub Assignment's Folder](assignment)
2. Open **ONLY** that folder that you created in VSCode.  This is important for the `assignment.py` file to find `cse251turtle.py`.  Here are two methods of opening a folder in VSCode.
	- On the Visual Studio menu bar, choose `File > Open > Folder`, and then browse to the code location.
	- On the context (right-click) menu of a folder containing code, choose the Open in Visual Studio command.

3. Run `assignment.py`.  It will draw the shapes in the image above.  These shapes are drawn without using threads.  Each type of shape is drawn one at a time - one after the other.  Here are the functions used for drawing.

	```python
	draw_squares(tur)
	draw_circles(tur)
	draw_triangles(tur)
	draw_rectangles(tur)
	```

4. Look for `TODO` comments in the program.  You will be creating and executing 4 threads.  Each thread will call one of the `draw_?(tur)` functions above.  (I.e. one thread calls `draw_squares()`, another calls `draw_circles()`, etc...).  Your goal is not to draw the shapes in the same order as the non-threaded function, but to end up with the same results.  The threads must be running concurrently and take turns drawing their shape.  For example, you should see some (not all) squares drawn, then circles, then rectangles, then squares again, then triangles, etc.  You can create extra functions if required.
5. You should not change any of the Log statements in the assignment. (See below section on the Logger class)
1. You are not allowed to use any other Python modules/packages than the packages currently imported.
1. You can create other functions if needed.
1. No global variables.


## CSE 251 Logger

This assignment uses the Log class found in `cse251.py`. Refer to the [log class documentation](../overview/cse251_code.md)

The assignment program will creating the following logging information.  Here is the output from the assignment program before adding threads.

```text
14:25:40| Start Drawing No Threads
14:25:40| All drawing commands have been created = 0.16962150
14:25:40| Number of Drawing Commands: 1047
14:25:59| At end of drawing = 18.68426980
14:25:59| Start Drawing With Threads

## Rubric

Assignments are not accepted late. Instead, you should submit what you have completed by the due date for partial credit.

Assignments are individual and not team based.  Any assignments found to be  plagiarised will be graded according to the `ACADEMIC HONESTY` section in the syllabus. The Assignment will be graded in broad categories as outlined in the syllabus:

## Submission

When finished, upload your Python file to Canvas.
