Course: CSE 251
Lesson Week: 10

Author: <your name>

Purpose: assignment for week 10 - reader writer problem

Instructions:

- Review TODO comments

- writer: a process that will "write"/send numbers to the reader.  
  To keep things simple, send random values from 0 to 255 to the reader.

- reader: a process that receive numbers sent by the writer.

- You don't need any sleep() statements for either process.

- You are able to use lock(s) and semaphores(s).  When using locks, you can't
  use the arguments "block=False" or "timeout".

- You must use ShareableList between the two processes.  
  You are only allowed to use BUFFER_SIZE number of positions
  in this ShareableList for tranfering data from the writer to
  the reader.  However, you can use other parts of the ShareableList
  for other purposes if you want by increasing the size of the ShareableList.
  This buffer area will act like a queue - First In First Out.

- Not allowed to use Queue(), Pipe(), List() or any other data structure.

- Not allowed to use Value() or Array() or any other shared data type from 
  the multiprocessing package.

Add any comments for me:
